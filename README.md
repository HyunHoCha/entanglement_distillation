# Learning Entanglement Distillation Protocols via Machine Learning

This program proposes a machine learning-based approach for learning **Entanglement Distillation** protocols. Unlike traditional methods (e.g., BBPSSW) that are only effective for specific quantum states, this framework enables more general entanglement distillation using data-driven techniques.

## Features

- **Machine Learning-Based Protocol Discovery**:
  - Learns optimal distillation protocols from data rather than relying on analytically derived rules.

- **Generalization to Arbitrary States**:
  - Designed to work on arbitrary mixed quantum states using LOCC (Local Operations and Classical Communication) strategies.

---

## Main Functions

- **Data-Driven Protocol Learning**:
  - Learns new entanglement distillation protocols through data rather than mathematical derivations.

- **LOCC-Based Optimization**:
  - Optimizes protocols using LOCC operations that are feasible to implement in real-world quantum computing.

## How to Use

```bash
python3 main.py  # Run to learn entanglement distillation protocols
